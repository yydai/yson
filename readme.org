* JSON parser

This JSON parser is just a demo, but most features of JSOΝ is supported.

** How to use

You can run the demo of  test.py:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
python test.py
#+END_SRC

I have uploaded this package to pypi, so you can install it with:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install yson
#+END_SRC

and

#+BEGIN_SRC python
yson.loads('{"test": 12345678}')
#+END_SRC

** How to distribute it to PyPI
    - get account of PyPI and pypitest
    - config ~/.pypirc with your user name and password
    - upload it to test server
    - upload it to PyPI

    This is the command for test:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    python setup.py register -r pypitest
    python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest
    #+END_SRC

    And this will upload the package to PyPI
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    python setup.py register -r pypi
    python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
    #+END_SRC


** In the future
I will continue to imporve this demo.
